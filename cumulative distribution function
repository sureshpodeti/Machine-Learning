** Cumulative Distribution function **
  The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable is another method to describe the distribution of random variables.
  The advantage of the CDF is that it can be defined for any kind of random variable (discrete, continuous, and mixed)
  
  But PMF(probability mass function) is only defined for discrete random variables not applicable for continuous random variable.
  
  
  Definition: 
   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of random variable X is defined as
        FX(x)=P(X≤x), for all x∈R.
        
 Example: I toss a coin twice. Let X be the number of observed heads. Find the CDF of X
        Two trials are independent, No physical interaction or either coin has memory
        Sample space S = {HT,HH, TH, TT} , |S| = 4
        Let X be random variable that defines #.of heads observed, with Rx = {0,1,2}
        Px(X) = 1/4, for X=0
                1/2, for X=1
                1/4, for X=2
                0, otherwise
        Cumulative Distribution function CDF;
        Fx(X) = 0, for X<0
                1/4, for 0<=X<1
                3/4, for 1<=X<2
                1, for X>=2

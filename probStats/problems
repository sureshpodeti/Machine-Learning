1.Q) In a presidential election, there are four candidates. Call them A, B, C, and D. Based on our polling analysis, 
we estimate that A has a 20 percent chance of winning the election, while B has a 40 percent chance of winning. 
What is the probability that A or B win the election?

Answer: In election any one of only one candidate wins out of A,B,C,D.
        Winning probabilities:
        P(A) = 0.20, P(B) = 0.40
        
        Outcome of the events , S(sample space)  = {A,B,C,D}
        Each outcome is not equally likely. Since, P(A) ≠ P(B). 
        (For outcomes to be equally likely probabilities of occurance of each outcome must be same)
        
        In elections we assume winninig of any of the both the candidates is not possible
        outcomes comes are disjoint, cannot both occur at the same time.
        Hence, they are mutually exclusive outcomes, dependent outcomes
        
        P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.20 + 0.40 = 0.60
        
        

2.Q) You roll a fair die. What is the probability of E={1,5}?
   
Answer: Outcomes of rolling die, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
        Each outcome is equally likely, why? P({1}) = P({2}) = P({3}) = P({4}) = P({5}) = P({6}) = 1/6
        Any of the two outcomes cannot occur at the same time.
        Hence, outcomes are mutually exclusive, disjoint.
        
       let A be an event of occuring A = {2}, B = {5}
       
       Event E can be written as E = A ∪ B = {2} ∪ {5} = {2,5}
       P(E) = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6+1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3

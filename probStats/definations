Random Experiment:
      Is a process by which we observe something uncertain

Outcome:
      Result of a random experiment
     
Sample Space:
      Set of all possible outcomes
      
Event:
      A subset of the sample space
      
Eg:  Tossing a fair-unbiased coin 3 times 
     This process is random beacuse we observe something uncertain.
     Outcome is the result of this experiment.
     
     Sample space = {(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}
     Each subset in the set an Event
     
     
Tossing a fair-unbiased coin:
  It is random experiment: we observe something uncertain 
  Outcomes are getting head or tail
  Sample Space = {H, T}
  Event could be:
     Getting heads
     Getting tails

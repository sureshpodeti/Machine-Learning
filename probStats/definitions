Random Experiment:
      Is a process by which we observe something uncertain Eg. Tossing a coin, Rolling die

Outcome:
      Result of a random experiment, Eg: Out come of coin toss are HEAD or TAIL
     
Sample Space:
      Set of all possible outcomes Eg: S = {HEAD, TAIL}, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      
Event:
      A subset of the sample space 
      Eg: Event of getting head on first coin toss {HEAD}, Even of getting even number when roll a die {2,4,6}
      
Eg:  Tossing a fair-unbiased coin 3 times 
     This process is random beacuse we observe something uncertain.
     Outcome is the result of this experiment.
     
     Sample space = {(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}
     Each subset in the set an Event
     
     
Tossing a fair-unbiased coin:
  It is random experiment: we observe something uncertain 
  Outcomes are getting head or tail
  Sample Space = {H, T}
  Event could be:
     Getting heads
     Getting tails


** Probability is only defined for events. i.e P({2,4,6}) probability of getting even number when we roll a die

** Equally likely Outcomes: Equal likeness or probability of occurance of each outcome 
  Eg: Coin toss, S ={HEAD, TAIL}, p({HEAD}) = p({TAIL}) = 0.50
  
 ** Equally likely Events - Both events are equal in probability in occurance
 
 ** Mutually exclusive Events- 
 
 
 ** Disjoint Events
 
 
 
 ** Dependent Events
 
 
 ** Independent Events

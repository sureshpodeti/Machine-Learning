Random Experiment:
      Is a process by which we observe something uncertain Eg. Tossing a coin, Rolling die

Outcome:
      Result of a random experiment, Eg: Out come of coin toss are HEAD or TAIL
     
Sample Space:
      Set of all possible outcomes Eg: S = {HEAD, TAIL}, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      
Event:
      A subset of the sample space 
      Eg: Event of getting head on first coin toss {HEAD}, Even of getting even number when roll a die {2,4,6}
      
Eg:  Tossing a fair-unbiased coin 3 times 
     This process is random beacuse we observe something uncertain.
     Outcome is the result of this experiment.
     
     Sample space = {(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}
     Each subset in the set an Event
     
     
Tossing a fair-unbiased coin:
  It is random experiment: we observe something uncertain 
  Outcomes are getting head or tail
  Sample Space = {H, T}
  Event could be:
     Getting heads
     Getting tails


** Probability is only defined for events. i.e P({2,4,6}) probability of getting even number when we roll a die

** Equally likely Outcomes: Equal likeness or probability of occurance of each outcome 
  Eg: Coin toss, S ={HEAD, TAIL}, p({HEAD}) = p({TAIL}) = 0.50
  
 ** Equally likely Events - Both events are equal in probability in occurance
 
 ** Mutually exclusive Events- If two events are disjoint or both the events cannot occur at the same time we say they are Mutually
  Exclusive Events. Eg: Tossing a coin, S = {HEAD, TAIL}
  
  Events A = {HEAD} Getting heads, B = {TAIL} Getting tails both cannot occur at the same time for one trail.
  
  Hence, Event A and B are disjoint or Mutually Exclusive
 
 
 ** Disjoint Events - Mutually exclusive Events
 
 
 
 ** Dependent Events - Probability of occurance of Event B changes in the presence of occurance of Event A.
   Probability of one event depends on the occurance of other event.
   
   Eg: Coin toss,Event A = p({HEAD}) and Event B = p({TAIL}) are dependent events.
   if we know occurance of getting heads, that affects the occurance of other event of getting tails
 
 
 ** Independent Events - Two events are independent if they are disjoint. Probability of occurance of one doesnot affect the
 Probability of other. Some times independence of two events is quite clear because the two events seem
 not to have any physical interaction with each other(ex: event A = coin toss, event B=rolling die) . At other times, 
 it is not as clear and we need to check if they satisfy the independence condition. P(A ∩ B)  = P(A) * P(B)
 
 
example: I pick a random number from {1,2,3,⋯,10}, and call it N. Suppose that all outcomes are equally likely. 
Let A be the event that N is less than 7, and let B be the event that N is an even number. Are A and B independent?

solution: P(A) = 0.60, P(B) = 0.50 , P(A ∩ B)  = P(A) * P(B) , 0.30 = 0.60*0.50, Yes they are independent

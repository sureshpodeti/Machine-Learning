What is Probability?
  Is it (#.of possible outcomes/ total #.of possible outcomes)?
  
  
  Think of following cases:
   1. Fair-Unbiased Coin: P(getting heads)  = possibilty/ total no.of possiblities
                          P(getting heads)  = 1/2 = 0.50
                          
   2. Rough-Biased Coin: P(getting heads) = possibilty/ total no.of possiblities  [According to defination]
                                          = 1/2 = 0.50  (Is this correct??)
                                          
    No, the defination is not correct.
    
    Then, what is the correct defination?
     P(getting heads) = chance/fraction of getting heads by performing large number of trials(infinite trails) by flipping coin
     , if we do that there is a high chance of getting P(getting heads) close to 0.50 (approx) [Look at central limit theorem]

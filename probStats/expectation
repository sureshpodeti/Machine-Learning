** Expectation **
Notation: 
  Let X be the random variable with range Rx
  EX = E[X] = E(X) 
  mostly used E[X]
  
  Average is a single number that describes the whole collection. 
  The expected value is defined as the weighted average of the values in the range.
  
  E[X] = k ∈ Rx ∑ k* Px(X=k) 
  
  
Q. Let X∼Bernoulli(p). Find EX.?
solution: Since X∼Bernoulli(p), Range(X) = Rx = {0,1}
   E[X] = 0*(1-p) + 1*p = p

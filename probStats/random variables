*Random Variable*
 Real valued function that assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of the random experiment.
 Real valued function that maps each outcome with a numerical value based on some criteria
 
  Let X be random variable; X: S â†’ R , S = sample space, R real value
 Denoted by capital letters X,Y,Z.. etc.
 
 Eg: Tossing a coin 5 times. 
      Possible outcomes are S = {TTTTT,TTTTH,...,HHHHH}, total 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes are there
      Let X be the random variable the maps the possible outcomes to the no.of heads in each outcome
      
      X  = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
      
*Range of random variable*
  Represented as Rx or Range(X); set of possible values of X, the random variable
  
  Range(X)=RX={0,1,2,3,4,5}

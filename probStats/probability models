Probability models are divided into:
  1. Discrete probability
  2. Continous probability
  
  based on their sample spaces.
  
  If sample space S is countable set, this refers to a discrete probability model;
  Since, S is countable, we can list all the elements in S;
     S = {s1, s2, s3, ...}

  If A ⊂ S is an event, then A is also countable, and we can write as 
          P(A) = ∑ P(sj) ; Thus is a countable sample space, to find probability of an event, all
          we need to do is sum the probability of individual elements in that set.
          
          
          
  Continous Probability Model:
    Let S be sample space, S ∈[0,1]. This is an uncontable set; We cannot list the elements in the set.
    We use integration instead of summation here.

### What is a vector?
# Vector is a container which represents all the quantities/ #possibilities of a quantity in different directions.

# eg. I have scored runs 1,3,4,6,6,0 in an over in cricket.
# I can represent this in a single vector, scores <- c(1,3,4,6,6,0)
# where first element is in x1 direction ,second element in x2.
#last one in x6 dimension.



### What is matrix?
# Suppose, how would you represent couple of vectors pointed in #different direction?. Matrix is a single container which represent
#differently pointed vector in one notation.
# a <- c(1,2);b <- c(3,4)
# m <- matrix(c(a, b), nrow=2)


### Matrix vector multiplication?
# see image 


### Matrix-Matrix multiplication?

### tranpose of a matrix?



### Inverse of a matrix?



### Vector space?

### Column space?

### Basis of a vector space?

### Projection?

### Solving Ax=b, where we don't have solution?
